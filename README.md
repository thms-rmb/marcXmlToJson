# MarcXmlToJson

MarcXmlToJson is an experimental utility that converts MARCXML to JSON, according to the description in [this link](https://github.com/marc4j/marc4j/wiki/MARC-in-JSON-Description).

It reads from standard input and writes to standard output. The only command line parameter is `-i`, which turns on indented output.

The utility is written in C# and runs on the .NET runtime.
